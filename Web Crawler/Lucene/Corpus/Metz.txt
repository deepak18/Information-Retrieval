the tripoint along the junction of france, germany, and luxembourg, the city forms a central place of the european greater region and the saarlorlux euroregion. metz has a rich 3,000-year-history, having variously been a celtic oppidum, an important gallo-roman city, the merovingian capital of the austrasia kingdom, the birthplace of the carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in europe. the city has been steeped in romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by germanic culture due to its location and history. because of its historical, cultural, and architectural background, metz has been submitted on france's unesco world heritage tentative list. the city features noteworthy buildings such as the gothic saint-stephen cathedral with its largest expanse of stained-glass windows in the world, the basilica of saint-pierre-aux-nonnains being the oldest church in france, its imperial station palace displaying the apartment of the

etymology[edit] in ancient times, the town was known as "city of mediomatrici", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name. after its integration into the roman empire, the city was called divodurum mediomatricum, meaning holy village or holy fortress of the mediomatrici, then it was known as mediomatrix. during the 5th century ad, the name evolved to "mettis", which gave rise to metz. history[edit] main articles: history of metz and timeline of metz henry ii of france entering metz in 1552, putting an end to the republic of metz. metz has a recorded history dating back over 3,000 years. before the conquest of gaul by julius caesar in 52 bc, it was the oppidum of the celtic mediomatrici tribe. integrated into the roman empire, metz became quickly one of the principal towns of gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the franks about the end of the 5th century. between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the merovingian kings of austrasia. after the treaty of verdun in 843, metz became the capital of the kingdom of lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the holy roman empire, being granted semi-independent status. during the 12th century, metz rose to the status of republic and the republic of metz ruled until the 15th century. with the signature of the treaty of chambord in 1552, metz passed to the hands of the kings of france. under french rule, metz was selected as capital of the three bishoprics and became a strategic fortified town. with creation of the departments by the estates-general of 1789, metz was chosen as capital of the department of moselle. after the defeat of france during the franco-prussian war and according to the treaty of frankfurt of 1871, the city was annexed into the german empire, being part of the imperial territory of alsace-lorraine and serving as capital of the german department of lorraine. metz remained german until the end of world war i, when it reverted to france. however, after the battle of france during the second world war, the city was annexed once more by the german third reich. in 1944, the attack on the city by the u.s. third army freed the city from german rule and metz reverted one more time to france after world war ii. during the 1950s, metz was chosen to be the capital of the newly created lorraine region. with the creation of the european community and the later european union, the city has become central to the greater region and the saarlorlux euroregion. geography[edit] dawn sky in metz metz is located on the banks of the moselle and the seille rivers, 43 km (26.7 mi) from the schengen tripoint where the borders of france, germany, and luxembourg meet. the city was built in a place where many branches of the moselle river creates several islands, which are encompassed within the urban planning. the terrain of metz forms part of the paris basin and presents a plateau relief cut by river valleys presenting cuestas in the north-south direction. metz and its surrounding countryside are included in the forest and crop lorraine regional natural park, covering a total area of 205,000 ha (506,566.0 acres). climate[edit] the climate of lorraine is a semi-continental climate. the summers are humid and hot, sometimes stormy, and the warmest month of the year is august, when temperatures

1892, oil on canvas, golden courtyard museums metz with its magnificent open countries, prolific undulating rivers, wooded hillsides, vineyards of fire; cathedral all in volute, where the wind sings as a flute, and responding to it via the mutte: this big voice of the good lord! ??paul verlaine, ode to metz, invectives, 1896 population[edit] the inhabitants of metz are called messin(e)s. statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of metz are haphazard, as the french republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking. the french national census of 2012 estimated the population of metz to be 119,551, while the population of metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851. through history, metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. more recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry. the historical population for the current area of metz municipality is as follows: notable people linked to the city[edit] main article: list of people from metz several well-known figures have been linked to the city of metz throughout its history. renowned messins include poet paul verlaine, composer ambroise thomas, and mathematician jean-victor poncelet; numerous well-known german figures were also born in metz notably during the annexation periods. moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer fran?ois rabelais, cardinal mazarin, political thinker alexis de tocqueville, french patriot and american revolutionary war hero marquis gilbert du motier de la fayette, and luxembourg-born german-french statesman robert schuman. law and government[edit] local law[edit] main article: local law in alsace-moselle the local law (french: droit local) applied in metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with french law. created in 1919, it preserves the french laws applied in france before 1870 and maintained by the germans during the annexation of alsace-lorraine, but repealed in the rest of france after 1871. it also maintains german laws enacted by the german empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and french laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in alsace-lorraine. this specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance. the most striking of the legal differences between france and alsace-lorraine is the absence in alsace-lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the french government. alsace-lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the roman catholic, lutheran, and calvinist churches and the jewish religion. administration[edit] the city hall on the place d'armes. like every commune of the present french republic, metz is managed by a mayor (french: maire)

of the largest urban conservation areas in france, and more than 100 of the city's buildings are classified on the monument historique list. because of its historical and cultural background, metz is designated as french town of art and history, and has been submitted on to france's unesco world heritage tentative list. the city is famous for its yellow limestone architecture, a result of the extensive use of jaumont stone. the historic district has kept part of the gallo-roman city with divodurum's cardo maximus, then called via scarponensis (today the trinitaires, taison, and serpenoise streets), and the decumanus maximus (today en fournirue and d'estr?es streets). at the cardo and decumanus intersection was situated the roman forum, today the saint-jacques square. architecture[edit] the centre pompidou-metz, a symbol of modern metz the music box, a high-quality concert and recording studio venue dedicated to the modern forms of art music, in the borny district. the venue has been erected in a cit? hlm as an urban renewal effort from its gallo-roman past, the city preserves vestiges of the thermae (in the basement of the golden courtyard museum), parts of the aqueduct, and the basilica of saint-pierre-aux-nonnains. saint louis' square with its vaulted arcades and a knights templar chapel remains a major symbol of the city's high medieval heritage. the gothic saint-stephen cathedral, several churches and h?tels, and two remarkable municipal granaries reflect the late middle ages. examples of renaissance architecture can be seen in h?tels from the 16th century, such as the house of heads (french: maison des t?tes). the city hall and the buildings surrounding the town square are by french architect jacques-fran?ois blondel, who was awarded the task of redesigning and modernizing the centre of metz by the royal academy of architecture in 1755 the context of the enlightenment. neoclassical buildings from the 18th century, such as the opera house, the intendant palace (the present-day prefecture), and the royal governor's palace (the present-day courthouse) built by charles-louis cl?risseau, are also found in the city. the imperial district was built during the first annexation of metz by the german empire. in order to "germanise" the city, emperor wilhelm ii decided to create a new district shaped by a distinctive blend of germanic architecture, including renaissance, neo-romanesque and neo-classical, mixed with elements of art nouveau, art deco, alsatian and mock-bavarian styles. instead of jaumont stone, commonly used everywhere else in the city, stone used in the rhineland, such as pink and grey sandstone, granite and basalt were used. the district features noteworthy buildings including the rail station and the central post office by german architect j?rgen kr?ger. modern architecture can also be seen in the town with works of french architects roger-henri expert (sainte-th?r?se-de-l'enfant-j?sus church, 1934), georges-henri pingusson (fire station, 1960), and jean dubuisson (subdivisions, 1960s). the refurbishment of the former ney arsenal as a concert hall in 1989 and the erection of the metz arena in 2002, by spanish and french architects ricardo bofill and french paul chemetov represent the postmodern movement. the centre pompidou-metz museum in the amphitheatre district represents a strong architectural initiative to mark the entrance of metz into the 21st century. designed by japanese architect shigeru ban, the building is remarkable for the complex, innovative carpentry of its roof, and integrates concepts of sustainable architecture. the project encompasses the architecture of two recipients of the pritzker architecture prize, shigeru ban (2014) and french christian de portzamparc (1994). the amphitheatre district is also conceived by french architects nicolas michelin, jean-paul viguier, and jean-michel wilmotte and designer philippe starck. the urban project is expected to be completed by 2023. further, a contemporary music venue designed by contextualist french architect rudy ricciotti stands in the borny district. urban ecology[edit] water games on the islands district under the leadership of such people as botanist jean-marie pelt, metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s. because of the failure of post-war urban planning and housing estate development in europe during the 1960s, mostly based on the concepts of ciam, jean-marie pelt, then municipal councillor of metz, initiated a new approach to the urban environment. based initially on the ideas of the chicago school, pelt's theories pleaded for better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept centered on the relationship between "stone and water". his policy was realized in metz by the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the moselle and the seille rivers and the development of large pedestrian areas. as a result, metz has over 37 m2 (400 sq ft) of open areas per inhabitant in the form of numerous public gardens in the city. the principles of urban ecology are still applied in metz with the implementation of a local agenda 21 action plan. the municipal ecological policy encompasses the sustainable refurbishment of ancient buildings, the erection of sustainable districts and buildings, green public transport, and the creation of public gardens by means of landscape architecture. additionally, the city has developed its own combined heat and power station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. with a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45mw boiler of the plant provides electricity and heat for 44,000 dwellings. the metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in france. military architecture[edit] see also: fortifications of metz the germans' gate from the 13th century, one of the last medieval bridge castles found in france as a historic garrison
