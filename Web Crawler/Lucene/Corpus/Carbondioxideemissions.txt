list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions - wikipedia from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (redirected from carbon dioxide emissions) countries by carbon dioxide emissions in thousands of tonnes per annum, via the burning of fossil fuels (blue the highest and green the lowest). carbon dioxide emissions for the top 40 countries by total emissions in 2013, given as totals and per capita. data from eu edgar database the cumulative co2 emissions between 1970 and 2013 from the top 40 countries in the world, including some extra-national bodies. the data comes from the eu edgar database china co 2 emission in millions of tonnes from 1980 to 2009. this is a list of sovereign states and territories by carbon dioxide emissions due to certain forms of human activity, based on the edgar database created by european commission and netherlands environmental assessment agency released in 2014. the following table lists the 2014 annual co2 emissions estimates (in thousands of co2 tonnes) along with a list of emissions per capita (in tonnes of co2 per year) from same source. the data only considers carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but not emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry. emissions from international shipping or bunker fuels are also not included in national figures, which can make a huge difference for small countries with important ports. the top 10 largest emitter countries account for 68.2% of the world total. other powerful, more potent greenhouse gases are not included in this data, including methane. see also[edit] global warming portal ecology portal environment portal energy portal list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita list of countries by carbon intensity list of countries by electricity production from renewable sources list of countries by greenhouse gas emissions list of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita list of countries by ratio of gdp to carbon dioxide emissions general: world energy consumption notes and references[edit] ^ schrooten, l; de vlieger, ina; int panis, luc; styns, r. torfs, k; torfs, r (2008).
