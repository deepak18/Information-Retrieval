hydrogen technologies - wikipedia from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia see also: timeline of hydrogen technologies hydrogen technologies are technologies that relate to the production and use of hydrogen. hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses. some hydrogen technologies are carbon neutral and could have a role in preventing climate change and a possible future hydrogen economy. hydrogen is a widely used chemical used in various applications including ammonia production, oil refining and energy. hydrogen is not a primary energy source, because it is not naturally occurring as a fuel. it is, however widely regarded as an ideal energy storage medium, due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through electrolysis and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell. there are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells. the potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel. fuel cells[edit] main article: fuel cell further information: glossary of fuel cell terms alkaline fuel cell (afc) direct borohydride fuel cell (dbfc) direct carbon fuel cell (dcfc) direct-ethanol fuel cell (defc) direct methanol fuel cell (dmfc) electro-galvanic fuel cell (egfc) flow battery (rfc) formic acid fuel cell (fafc) metal hydride fuel cell (mhfc) microbial fuel cell (mfc) molten-carbonate fuel cell (mcfc) phosphoric-acid fuel cell (pafc) photoelectrochemical cell (pec) proton exchange membrane fuel cell (pemfc) protonic ceramic fuel cell (pcfc) regenerative fuel cell (rfc) solid-oxide fuel cell (sofc) hydrogen infrastructure[edit] main article: hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pressure letdown station compressed hydrogen tube trailer liquid hydrogen tank truck hydrogen piping hydrogen station hcng homefueler home energy station hydrogen highway zero regio hydrogen compressor electrochemical hydrogen compressor guided rotor compressor hydride compressor ionic liquid piston compressor linear compressor hydrogen turboexpander-generator hydrogen leak testing hydrogen sensor hydrogen purifier hydrogen analyzer hydrogen valve hydrogen storage[edit] main article: hydrogen storage compressed hydrogen cryo-adsorption liquid hydrogen slush hydrogen underground hydrogen storage hydrogen tank power to gas hydrogen vehicles[edit] main article: hydrogen vehicles further information: list of fuel cell vehicles historic hydrogen filled airships[edit] hindenburg (airship) zeppelin hydrogen powered cars[edit] hydrogen fueling nozzle audi: 2004 -
