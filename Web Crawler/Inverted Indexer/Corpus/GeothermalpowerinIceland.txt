geothermal power in iceland - wikipedia from wikipedia the free encyclopedia geothermal borehole outside the reykjanes power station due to the geological location of iceland over a rift in continental plates the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy the heating and production of electricity during winter pavements near these areas such as reykjavik and akureyri are heated up five major geothermal power plants exist in iceland which produce approximately 26.2 2010 of the nation s electricity in addition geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements of approximately 87 of all buildings in iceland apart from geothermal energy 73.8 of the nation s electricity is generated by hydro power and 0.1 from fossil fuels citation needed consumption of primary geothermal energy in 2004 was 79.7 petajoules pj approximately 53.4 of the total national consumption of primary energy 149.1 pj the corresponding share for hydro power was 17.2 petroleum was 26.3 and coal was 3 plans are underway to turn iceland into a 100 fossil-fuel-free nation in the near future for example iceland s abundant geothermal energy has enabled renewable energy initiatives such as carbon recycling international s carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process the following are the five largest power stations in iceland hellishei i power station 303 mw nesjavellir geothermal power station 120 mw reykjanes power station 100 mw svartsengi power station 76.5 mw krafla power station 60 mw see also edit list of power stations in iceland renewable energy in iceland the geothermal energy exhibition iceland deep drilling project renewable energy by country
