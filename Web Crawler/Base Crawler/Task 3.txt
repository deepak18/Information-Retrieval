Merging with minimal loss of quality->

Pages at the same depth in their individual web graph:
	Merging single urls form each graphs which is at the earliest on the page.
	
Pages at shallow depth from both web graphs will be merged first.

So, on the same depth, one-one URL from each which comes first on the webpage.
and, on different depths, including the one which is at shallower.
