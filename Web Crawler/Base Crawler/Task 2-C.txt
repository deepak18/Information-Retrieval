Focused Crawling looks for the keyword "solar" in either the url text or anchor text.
BFS takes the seed and crawls over the whole page and then does the same task for each page it gets
(crawling first those which comes first on the page)

DFS takes the seed and each time crawls the first link it gets on the page and perform the same task this time on the new link,
till reaches the maximum depth.
(going deeper with the first link, till max depth)


Total no of crawls in case of BFS is around 80,000 ; whereas
Total no of crawls in case of DFS is around 3,60,000.

Starting with the same root, the first link on both BFS and DFS is same.

The third link in the DFS that signifies the first element at depth=3, 
which comes as link no. 512 in BFS,
that means total links in BFS, at level 1 =1
							   at level 2 =510
